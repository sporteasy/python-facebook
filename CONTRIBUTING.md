Feel free to submit pull requests.

The idea is to mimic the PHP SDK with as less change as possible in the
sdk module so that long term maintenance is easier.

The code specific to this project is written outside of the sdk module.

When committing, keep all lines to less than 100 characters, and try to
follow the existing style (pep8).

Add the comments where needed, and provide ample explanation in the
commit message.
